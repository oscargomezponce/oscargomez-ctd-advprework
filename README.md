# Star Wars Explorer

A simple web app that allows users to explore Star Wars characters and films using data from the [Swapi.Tech API](https://swapi.tech/).

This is a project by Oscar Gomez, developed to present for Code The Dream's Advanced Pre Work.

I hope I get a chance to learn Python this season.

And yes, I'm a Star Wars fan.

Forget about the Skywalkers (Vader included).

Emperor Palpatine is king.
